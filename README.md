# General instructions

1. Fork or clone this repository into your own github account.
1. All your work will be done in your repository.
1. Inspect the code and understand what it's doing.
1. When going through the steps below,
   create git commits, making a history of
   changes that can be inspected later on.
1. At the end of the exercise you will *have* to push your code.
   You can also push regularly before that if you want.

# Steps
1. Both functions in the `object_analysis` module have a problem.
  1. Write a test for each function that demonstrates the problem.
  1. Fix the function and ensure the test passes.
1. Both functions' performance can be improved
   for performance and readability
  1. Describe how you would go about
     increasing the performance.
     #### How to increase the performance
     - Use Built-In Functions
     - Use Module Importing
     - Reduce the computation
     What steps would you take?
     #### Steps to increase the performance
     - Build in function such as max
     - Importing unittest module for test automation 
     - Reducing calculation and reduce memory usage by using less for loop and logical condition
     How do you determine what to improve?
     #### Determine what to improve
     - Tidy up the code
     - Save time, labor, cost when doing testing by automation and unittest.
     - System perform respond faster because it use less memory and less computation needed
  1. Try to increase the performance of both functions.
     Use only built-in python modules and types,
     don't bother trying to use external packages
     or writing code in lower-level languages.
  1. Try to improve the readibility of the functions.
1. The `object_analysis` module contains not only functions
  but also some little examples/mini-tests.
  Can you re-organise this?
1. The code has no comments nor descriptions. Add as appropriate.
1. Create a GitHub Action (or any other CI script)
   that runs automatic tasks after each commit.
   Add the tasks you think are relevant.
